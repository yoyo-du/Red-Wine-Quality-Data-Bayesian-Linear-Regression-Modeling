# Red-Wine-Quality-Data-Bayesian-Linear-Regression-Modeling
**STA 545 Bayesian Statistics Final Project**

The main purpose of this project was to use Bayesian approach to develop a proper linear regression model to model the wine quality based on the results of physicochemical tests. This project focused on variable selection and parameter estimation. Gibbs sampling algorithm was applied for sampling parameters from their posterior distributions. The prediction performance of the model is evaluated.

The dataset was retrieved from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
